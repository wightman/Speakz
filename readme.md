#Speakz

##What is it ?

**Speakz** is a *microblog* based on [Redis](http://code.google.com/p/redis/) and the [bottle.py framework](http://bottle.paws.de/). It is a port from [speakeasy](https://github.com/wightman/speakeasy), forked from  [retwis-py](https://github.com/pims/retwis-py) which is a *direct* python port of the [ruby version of Retwis](http://github.com/danlucraft/retwis-rb) by Daniel Lucraft.
